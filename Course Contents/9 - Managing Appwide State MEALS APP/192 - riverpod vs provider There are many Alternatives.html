<p>Older versions of this course used the "<em>provider</em>"&nbsp;package instead of "<em>riverpod</em>" for app-wide state management.</p><p>riverpod is a library created by the same developer as the provider library - it's essentially a re-write of the provider package, fixing many of the flaws of that library (also see:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod</a>).</p><p>That's why this course uses riverpod.</p><p>As mentioned in the section, there generally are many other alternative packages you could use instead - for example Redux or Bloc. <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This page</a> from the official documentation gives you a good overview of available packages - definitely feel free to play around with them and find the package your personally like most.</p>
