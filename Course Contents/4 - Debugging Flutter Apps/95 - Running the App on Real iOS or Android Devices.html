<p>In this course, we mainly run the app on virtual devices - the Android emulator or iOS&nbsp;simulator.</p><p>For development, using these virtual devices is great because changes are reflected almost instantly, you can use your real keyboard and benefit from many other convenience features.</p><p>But, of course, you should also test your app on some real devices at some point.</p><p>Therefore, the following articles provide step-by-step instructions on how to run your Flutter app on real Android or iOS&nbsp;devices (whilst developing it):</p><ul><li><p>Run on Android (when working on Windows): <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#set-up-your-android-device" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#set-up-your-android-device</a></p></li><li><p>Run on Android (when working on macOS): <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#set-up-your-android-device" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#set-up-your-android-device</a></p></li><li><p>Run on Android (when working on Linux): <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#set-up-your-android-device" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#set-up-your-android-device</a></p></li><li><p>Run on iOS&nbsp;(macOS&nbsp;only): <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#deploy-to-ios-devices" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#deploy-to-ios-devices</a></p></li></ul><p>Keep in mind that you can only build + run iOS&nbsp;apps when on a macOS&nbsp;device. Of course the code will be the same, no matter which platform you're using - but you can only build + run an iOS&nbsp;app from a Mac.</p><p><em>Flutter also supports other platforms - e.g, you can also build Windows or macOS desktop programs from your Flutter source code. However, this course focuses on building mobile apps for Android &amp;&nbsp;iOS. Nonetheless, you can of course use the official documentation to also try running your app on those other platforms.</em></p>
