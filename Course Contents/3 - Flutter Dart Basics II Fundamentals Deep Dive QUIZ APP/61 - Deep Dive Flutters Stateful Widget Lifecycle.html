<p>Every Flutter Widget has a built-in <strong>lifecycle</strong>:&nbsp;A collection of methods that are <strong>automatically executed</strong> by Flutter (at certain points of time).</p><p>There are <strong>three</strong> extremely important (stateful) widget lifecycle methods you should be aware of:</p><ul><li><p><code>initState()</code>:&nbsp;Executed by Flutter when the StatefulWidget's State object is <strong>initialized</strong></p></li><li><p><code>build()</code>:&nbsp;Executed by Flutter when the Widget is built for the <strong>first time</strong> AND&nbsp;after <code>setState()</code> was called</p></li><li><p><code>dispose()</code>: Executed by Flutter right before the Widget will be <strong>deleted</strong> (e.g., because it was displayed conditionally)</p></li></ul><p>You will encounter them all multiple times throughout the course - therefore you don't have to memorize them now and you will see them in action. It's still worth learning about them right now already.</p>
