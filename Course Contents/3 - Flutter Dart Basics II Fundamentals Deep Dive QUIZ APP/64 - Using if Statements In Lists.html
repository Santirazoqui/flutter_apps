<p>The <code>if</code> statement is a crucial feature of the Dart language - actually, it's a core feature of pretty much all programming languages.</p><p>In addition to what you learned in the previous lecture, in Dart, you may also use <code>if</code> inside of lists to conditionally add items to lists:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">final myList =&nbsp;[
  1,
  2,
  if (condition)
    3
];</pre><p>In this example, the number <code>3</code> will only be added to <code>myList</code> if <code>condition</code> was met (<code>condition</code> can be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> or a check that yields <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> - e.g., <code>day ==&nbsp;'Sunday'</code>).</p><p>Please note that there are <strong>NO&nbsp;curly braces</strong> around the <code>if</code> statement body. The <code>if</code> statement body also only comprises the next line of code (i.e., you can't have multiple lines of code inside the <code>if</code> statement).</p><p>You can also specify an <code>else</code> case - an alternative value that may be inserted into the list if <code>condition</code> is not met:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">final myList =&nbsp;[
  1,
  2,
  if (condition)
    3
  else
    4
];</pre><p>Using this feature is optional. Alternatively, you could, for example, also work with a ternary expression:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">final myList =&nbsp;[
  1,
  2,
  condition ? 3 : 4
];</pre><p>Especially when inserting more complex values (e.g., a widget with multiple parameters being set) into a more complex list (e.g., a list of widgets passed to a <code>Column()</code> or <code>Row()</code>), this feature can lead to more readable code.</p><p>You will also see it being used later in the course. It will be explained again then.</p><p>You can also learn more about this feature here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/accepted/2.3/control-flow-collections/feature-specification.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/accepted/2.3/control-flow-collections/feature-specification.md</a></p>
